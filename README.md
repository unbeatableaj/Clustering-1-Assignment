# Clustering-1-Assignment

# Introduction

Clustering is a technique used in unsupervised machine learning to group similar data points together. In this project, we will be performing clustering on the EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset to identify different groups of customers based on their flying patterns and preferences.

# Data Description

The EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset contains 3999 rows and 12 columns. The columns include various features of the customer, such as their frequent flyer miles, number of flights taken, amount of money spent on flights, and more.

# Methodology

We will be using K-means clustering, a popular clustering algorithm, to group customers together based on their flying patterns and preferences. K-means clustering works by partitioning data points into k clusters, where k is a predetermined number. The algorithm then iteratively assigns each data point to the cluster with the closest mean, and recalculates the mean of each cluster until convergence is reached.

We will first preprocess the data by scaling the features to ensure that they have the same scale. Then we will determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method . Finally, we will fit the K-means clustering algorithm 

# Results

Our analysis showed that the optimal number of clusters for this dataset is 4. The K-means clustering algorithm was able to group customers together based on their flying patterns and preferences. 

# Conclusion

Clustering is a powerful technique for identifying groups of similar data points. In this project, we used K-means clustering to group customers together based on their flying patterns and preferences. Our analysis showed that the optimal number of clusters for this dataset is 4. This information can be used by airlines to tailor their marketing efforts and loyalty programs to specific groups of customers.

Further analysis can be done on each cluster to identify the unique characteristics of each group of customers and how they differ from each other.
